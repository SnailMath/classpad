# classpad
This is a repository where I will put all information about the casio classpad II aka fx-cp400 that I could find.

Info: the fx-cg500 has the same firmware as the fx-cp400, so most of this will apply there too.

There are folders containing info about the hardware, for example one folder for the scif (serial communication interface).

There is also a folder for file formats.
